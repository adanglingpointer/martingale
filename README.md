# Martingale-Calc
Roulette martingale calculator

## Features
The Martingale-Calc allows your to run a randomized game of roulette, waiting for a specified number of duplicates to occur (black/red, odd/even, or high/low) before betting on the opposite.  Each time the bet is lost, the next wager is doubled.

This is a fun local javascript app of probability!
